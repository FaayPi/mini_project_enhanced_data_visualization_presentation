# Enhanced Sleep Quality Visualization

## Project Overview
This project extends the previous analysis on **sleep quality** by creating improved, interactive, and more visually appealing data visualizations. It leverages advanced Python libraries such as Plotly and Seaborn to present insights more clearly and engagingly. The output is organized either as an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

## Original Project
The foundational analysis and data can be found in the original repository:  
[Sleep Quality Analysis Repository]([https://github.com/your-username/original-sleep-quality-project](https://github.com/FaayPi/project-data-analytics-and-preprocessing.git)

## Running the Streamlit App
To run the interactive dashboard version, install Streamlit and launch the app with:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
